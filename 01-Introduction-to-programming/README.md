## Hello World 

##### 01.Block Letters

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.
Write a Python program that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

##### 02.Receipts for Lovely Loveseats

We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

## Control Flow

##### 03.Magic 8-Ball

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

#### 04.Sal's Shipping

Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.
In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.

## Lists

##### 05.Gradebook

You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.

##### 06.Len's Slice

You work at Len’s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.

## Loops

#### 07.Carly's Clippers

You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

You have been provided with three lists:
1. hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers.
2. prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list.
3. last_week: the number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the last week.

Each index in hairstyles corresponds to an associated index in prices and last_week.

## Functions

#### 08.Getting Ready for Physics Class

You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

## Basic Git Workflow

#### 09.The Boredless Tourist

Welcome to The Boredless Tourist, an online application giving you the power to find the parts of the city that fit the pace of your life. We at The Boredless Tourist run a recommendation engine using Python. We first evaluate what a person’s interests are and then give them recommendations in their area to venues, restaurants, and historical destinations that we think they’ll be engaged by. Let’s get started!

## Strings

#### 10.Thread Shed

You’ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.

## Dictionaries

#### 11. Scrabble

In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

## Classes 

#### 12. Basta Fazoolin'

You’ve started position as the lead programmer for the family-style Italian restaurant Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart. The restaurant has been doing fantastically and seen a lot of growth lately. You’ve been hired to keep things organized.

## Files

#### 13. Hacking The Fender

The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender‘s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.
