# Databases

## Working with your first database 

##### 01.Create a table 

In this project, you will create your own friends table and add/delete data from it!

## What can I do with a Database?

#### 02.New York Restaurants

We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

## Aggregate Functions

#### 03.Trends in Startups

Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

#### 04.How to Hack Hacker News

Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

+ title: the title of the story
+ user: the user who submitted the story
+ score: the score of the story
+ timestamp: the time of the story
+ url: the link of the story

## Multiple Tables

#### 05.Lyft Trip Data

Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

- trips: trips information
- riders: user data
- cars: autonomous cars

## How do I make and populate my own Database?

#### 06.Build A Menu For Bytes Of China

A new restaurant, Bytes of China, has just moved to a busy street in Chinatown from a previous location. Bytes of China has hired you to design its database schema so that it can display its menu on its new website. It has provided you with a copy of its current menu.

## Triggers

#### 07.Database Triggers

We are running an online watch store and need to make sure we have a record of when customer information is modified and to ensure changes match our business rules. We will be looking at a small subset of this database server and examining two tables, customers and customers_log. The information in these tables were randomly generated.

## How Do I Make Sure My Database Stays Intact?

#### 08.Building an Inventory Database with PostgreSQL

In this project you’ll build out a database schema that could be used to organize an inventory of mechanical parts. This schema will keep track of all the parts, their manufacturer, category, location in storeroom, available inventory, and other relevant information.

A database like this might be updated and queried by an inventory management application that accepts input from many users who might not be familiar with the database structure. As a result, we should make sure that there are sufficient data quality checks to ensure that only valid data can be entered into the database.

We’ll start with tables with just a few constraints and build upon them throughout the project.

#### 09.Data Exchange Service

This project will involve implementing a PostgreSQL database that’s suitable for storing data for a data sharing application. Imagine that your company has created a data platform that allows users to share datasets and the metadata (e.g. number of downloads, number of views, path to raw file).

A few select data publishers have been given access to your database and you’ve been tasked with setting up the permissions that allow these publishers to get relevant information about how users are interacting with the data they’ve uploaded.

## How Do I Make Sure My Database Stays Fast?

#### 10.Book Store Indexes

We are running an online book store and need to keep track of what books we offer. We’ll be working with a database of three tables. The books table is created from the top selling books of all time. The customers and orders tables are randomly generated.

#### 11. Intermediate Book Store Indexes

In this project, we’ll look at how adding more complex indexes can help (or hurt!) your database. Let’s imagine we are running an online book store and need to keep track of what books we offer. We’ll be working with a database of three tables. The books table is created from the top selling books of all time. The customers and orders tables are randomly generated.
