## Introduction to Computer Architecture

#### 01.Creating an Adder Circuit

At the most basic level, the computer you are typing on right now is a complex combination of the gates you have already learned how to construct. But how do we go from having a NAND gate, for example, to having an entire processor that runs Mac OS?

One step we can take towards this goal is to create an ALU, or an Arithmetic Logic Unit. An ALU can perform a bunch of bitwise operations like adding, subtracting, and shifting.

For this project, we are going to focus on creating one part of the ALU, the adder.
