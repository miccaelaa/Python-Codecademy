## Stacks

#### 01.Towers of Hanoi

Towers of Hanoi is an ancient mathematical puzzle that starts off with three stacks and many disks.The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

The game follows three rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

In this project, we are going to use our knowledge of stacks to implement this game!

## Hash Maps

#### 02.Blossom

The language of the flowers has a long history and has often been a topic resigned to the domain of dusty books in a thrift bookseller or a library. With Blossom, we want to give people lightning fast access to all of the possible meanings of their favorite flowers.

In this project, we are going to implement a hash map to relate the names of flowers to their meanings. In order to avoid collisions when our hashing function collides the names of two flowers, we are going to use separate chaining. We will implement the Linked List data structure for each of these separate chains.
